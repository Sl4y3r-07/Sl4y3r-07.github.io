I had the privilege of participating in the CSAW'23 Quals CTF as a member of InfosecIITR, and it proved to be a great experience. I am delighted to share the writeups for the challenges my team and I successfully solved during the competition.

## Reversing 
### Rebug1

```Description:-```
Can't seem to print out the flag :( Can you figure out how to get the flag with this binary?

```Challenge File:``` [file](/assests/CSAW/test.out)

This challenge was beginner level reversing challenge. To see the decompiled code, open the provided binary in IDA and press F5.

According to the code, the user is expected to input a 12-character string, and if the string length matches, they will receive a flag in response to the input.
Now run the binary and give any 12-character input and you'll get the flag.

Flag:- ```csawctf{c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710}```
